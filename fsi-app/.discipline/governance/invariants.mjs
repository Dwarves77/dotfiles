// INVARIANT REGISTRY — the per-INVARIANT enforcement map for all 6 platform skills.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (the "why wasn't this wired" answer, encoded): "wired" was previously measured
// per-SKILL ("a fitness function references this skill") instead of per-INVARIANT. A skill is a SET
// of invariants; wiring one (e.g. F10's syndication math) left the others honor-system — which is how
// the source-registration invariant (source-not-item → registered, never archived) slipped, producing
// 25 orphaned archives. This registry measures wiring per invariant.
//
// THE STANDARD (enforced by invariant-coverage.mjs, the meta-gate):
//   Every invariant is EITHER
//     (E) enforced  — `enforcedBy` lists ≥1 mechanism that RESOLVES to a real artifact, OR
//     (X) exempt    — `exempt.reason` states why it is NOT mechanically enforceable.
//   "Buildable but unbuilt" is NOT a valid exemption. Exemption is only for genuinely
//   non-mechanizable invariants (semantic generation properties, design judgment, process, or
//   signals too ambiguous for a low-false-positive gate). Each exemption names WHY.
//   `residual` (on enforced entries) names honestly what the mechanism does NOT cover (proxies).
//
// STANDING EXEMPTION-PROCESS RULE (2026-06-06 audit): before exempting an invariant as
// "weak-signal" or "non-mechanizable", you MUST check whether a DIFFERENT formulation is cleanly
// mechanizable — first-check-noisy does not mean none exists. Examples from the audit:
//   - a CEILING ("at most one") is often zero-false-positive where a FLOOR ("at least one") is noisy
//     (but VERIFY against live data — EP-7's ceiling was disproven: 224/361 briefs validly carry 2+);
//   - a branded TYPE makes a literal-scan-noisy invariant clean (SC-5 → mechanizable-via-refactor);
//   - a FK / table separation makes a "re-derived?" invariant structural (SC-4 → enforced);
//   - pgTAP makes a SQL-layer invariant testable (SC-3 SQL half → deferred-infra, named residual).
// If the cleaner formulation needs a refactor/infra you are NOT building now, the entry is
// "mechanizable-via-X, deferred for cost, REVISIT" — that is a NAMED-RESIDUAL, distinct from a true
// non-mechanizable exemption. Do not let deferred-for-cost masquerade as non-mechanizable.
//
// enforcedBy tokens (resolved by the meta-gate against live code/migrations):
//   rule:NNN          → a rule id present in ../manifest.mjs
//   fitness:FN        → a fitness id present in ../fitness/manifest.mjs
//   consistency:CN    → a check id present in ../consistency/manifest.mjs
//   audit:<path>      → a read-only verifier file that exists AND contains a GOVERNING skill-cite
//   selftest:<path>   → a *.selftest.mjs / *.test.mjs file that exists
//   migration:NNN     → a supabase/migrations/NNN_*.sql file that exists
//
// COMPLETENESS (also enforced by the meta-gate): each invariant carries an `anchor` (verbatim
// substring that MUST still be present in its skill file — catches an invariant being edited out),
// and each skill carries a normative-marker COUNT BASELINE (the gate fails if the marker count
// changes, forcing any new/removed normative statement to be triaged into this registry).

LADDER WIRING (2026-07-06 follow-up dispatch): the ladder is NOW the LIVE runtime fetch path — canonical-pipeline.ts fetchWithTransport delegates to transport-runtime.escalateToFetchResult (→ escalateFetch), so fetchMeta / blFetchClean / fetchPrimaryDeep and all three pool-INSERT sites route PER CLASS at runtime (API→apiFetchForHost, JS-shell/soft-404→render, block→try-both, 404→seek-more, exhaustion→NO_REACHABLE_SOURCE hold); transport-runtime.test.mjs proves the LIVE adapter routes per class red-then-green with the same real fixtures (dep-injected transports, no real fetch) + truncation-metadata preservation + the primary lastFailureText reason-carry. The TWO-DETECTOR leak is FOLDED: fetchWithTransport no longer calls bare detectRoadblock, and detectRoadblock now shares the classifier\'s isErrorBody 2500ch backstop (primary-fallback.mjs), so the 600-vs-2500 disagreement that stored the junk is structurally eliminated (proven by primary-fallback.test.mjs "TWO-HOMES FOLD"). NAMED RESIDUALS: (1) captureForStorage inherits isErrorBody\'s conservatism on the mid-size EUR-Lex 404 class — the classifier superset catches Request-Access + JS-shell but the >1500ch <2-marker soft-404 remains a named RD-13 residual until migration 147 sources.fetch_status persists the transport verdict; (2) the seek-more task (e) is emitted at runtime but its DURABLE home + the fetch_status verdict (f) still land with the hold-lift re-fetch batch + migration 147 (the runtime emits the task shape; persisting/queuing it is the next batch). HARD SEQUENCING GATE (RD-14, amended 2026-07-06 post-#198-merge): the hold-lift re-fetch (BATCH 1) has TWO preconditions and MUST NOT run until BOTH hold. PRECONDITION 1 (wiring) = SATISFIED: escalateFetch/escalateToFetchResult IS the LIVE runtime fetch path (fetchWithTransport delegates through it); do not run batch 1 against any code state where fetchWithTransport bypasses the ladder. PRECONDITION 2 (seek-more + durable audit) = NOT YET BUILT: seek-more candidate generation (identifier resolution + web-search feeding the url-array seam) AND a DURABLE per-item exhaustion-record home must exist first — under Earth-Exhaustion no item may reach a hold-or-delete call on unreachability grounds without a stored exhaustion record. NO SESSION RUNS BATCH 1 ON WIRING ALONE. The amended anti-parking invariant (an unreachability hold WITHOUT an exhaustion record = RED) ships WITH the seek-more unit, which must create the record shape first.',
