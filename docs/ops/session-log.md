# Session Log

Dated, appended entries. Newest first. Per the operating manual (standing rule #6 +
self-annealing protocol), session state lives here — never in `CLAUDE.md` (doctrine, not state).

## 2026-07-13 — register-step-gap (SC-13), stale-verified + backlog disposition, ISR, vault-graph

**Standing constraints held throughout:** `$0`, `GROUNDING_ACQUIRE_ENABLED` OFF, session moved **$0.00** (DB
reads + guarded metadata writes only; no grounding, no paid calls). Ceiling now $130 (code-only, not a spend
unlock). All merges CI-green on GitHub.

**Merged to master (final tip `44ddfee`):**
- **#308** — Program Board §7: corrected flag-system queue, ISR unit re-added, Unit 2 lineage, REJOIN line.
- **#309** — **register-step-gap unit (SC-13):** register-at-grounding is deterministic-only
  (`codifiedTierForHost`/`decidePoolHostRegistration`; codified→register, ambiguous→worklist, never a guessed
  tier). Probe-cleared (floor fails-closed on NULL both directions; guessed-5 census clean — 0 verified items
  rest on a guessed tier). Golden + invariant SC-13 + skill text; the `register-step-gap` flag text corrected to
  the live query. Residuals surfaced: brief-cited `?? 5` leak (follow-on), 124 guessed-5 rows.
- **#312** — **stale-verified root-cause + backlog disposition (Part A + Part B):**
  - Part A root-cause: `archivePatch()` resets `provenance_status` off `verified` on archive (the stale cache).
    Backfill of the 200 archived rows **BLOCKED on the bound reconciler credential** (mig-43 provenance guard;
    service_role denied) — go-forward fix lands, backfill re-runs when the cred is restored. `stale-verified-audit.mjs`
    (is_archived=false) GREEN (0/182 customer-visible). Corrected the over-stated "168 customer-facing" claim:
    all archived → 0 customer-visible stale-verified (cosmetic).
  - Part B: 336 past-bound → 60 RD-28-held + 20 quarantined-item-exempt (new flag-age boundary: quarantine-
    disposition-audit owns live-quarantined item-flags) + 256 closed (199 archived / 51 deleted / 5 seed / 1
    entity). 48 expired deferrals → 2 renewed + 128 closed-moot + 5 orphaned deleted. 124 guessed-5 → one FK-safe
    review-batch flag. **flag-age + deferral-hygiene both GREEN at exit.** register-gap was 52 live not 182.
- **#311** — ISR detail-cache (`unstable_cache` keyed by id + tag invalidation via a worker-authed revalidate
  route pinged from the workflow; `revalidate:300` backstop) — the 503 ceiling-removal.
- **#310** — vault docs-graph: 606 `[[wikilinks]]`→markdown relative links across 112 docs, ADR-010 amended
  (markdown links supersede wikilinks), 11 new cross-links, orphan triage.

**Decisions/notes:** `is_archived` is the primary axis for flag disposition (archived = terminally
dispositioned → close). The flag-age scope now correctly excludes live-quarantined item-flags (owned by
quarantine-disposition-audit). Ran 2 code/docs units as parallel isolated-worktree subagents (verified + merged).

**Blocked / operator-awaited:** (1) reconciler credential (blocks the archived-row provenance backfill + the
reconcile lane); (2) MCP cred-indirection in `~/.claude.json` — env-indirection is supported via `${VAR}` but
the ruling's verify-before-delete step needs a Claude Code restart (unverifiable in-session) — staged for the
operator; (3) the guessed-5 ambiguous-host registration batch (review-batch flag surfaced); (4) the next
sanctioned grounding run go/no-go (realizes the SC-13 flip + Unit-3 keepers).

**Next:** operator restart-verify for MCP indirection; reconciler-cred DDL window; then the sanctioned grounding
run and the standing sequence resume (T9 re-spec, registry expansion, T10 units, coverage floor, launch clauses).

## 2026-07-07 — §7 backend sweep + two integrity-clean data programs

**Accomplished** (6 PRs merged to prod, CI + both Vercel deploys green; master `63ba920`):

- **#227** — Template 11 verifier sign-off wired to the live table (migration 154, withdraw RLS policy).
- **#228** — Map mode filter wired to real `transport_modes` tags (was a pending note).
- **#229** — Member-created vertical groups (migration 155 `community_groups.vertical`; POST route; rail + create modal).
- **#230** — Org-scoped member ban with block-rejoin (migration 156 `org_member_bans` + `accept_invitation` ban guard; ban-then-delete fails closed).
- **#231** — State-cost data program: 13 US states' 2026 minimum wage → `state_cost_facts`, read-path wired to Operations By-state sub-list.
- **#232** — EIA price-board feed writer: 4 weekly spot figures → `published_price_statistics`.

**Data written** (durable on script execution, guarded + snapshotted + read-back verified):
- Batch-1 re-collection: 3 flipped → verified, 21 held with exhaustion records (cohort-fail stop held; no forced flips).
- 13 min-wage facts (source NCSL, tier 4, each corroborated vs a 2nd source; citations = NCSL enacting-instrument descriptors, never memory-recalled code sections).
- 4 EIA figures: WTI $73.59/bbl · Brent $73.63/bbl · Jet Fuel Gulf Coast $2.788/gal · Henry Hub $3.20/MMBtu (all week of 2026-06-26).

**Decisions** (operator rulings 2026-07-07 — also in memory `project_caros_ledge_2026_07_07_rulings`):
- **Cadence stays OFF** — `scrape_cadence='off'` + `global_processing_paused=true` unchanged. Conserve the ~20k/mo Browserless budget; mechanism is ready, enabling it commits autonomous spend. Reversible.
- **Member ban = ORG-SCOPED**, not platform-wide. Redesign mock copy ("blocks the account platform-wide") is SUPERSEDED; UI copy corrected to org-scoped.
- **Both data programs RUN** with REAL cited figures — never fabricated ticks.

**Integrity note (the vetting question, answered by outcome):** for external price data, prefer the
keyed authoritative API over WebFetch of gov HTML. DOL/FRED/EIA data *pages* return 403 to bots; the
**EIA v2 API** (`EIA_API_KEY` in `.env.local`) returns exact dated JSON values + release period.
A vague search snippet ("~$69/bbl", no date/release) was explicitly REFUSED rather than written.
Same keys available and preferred: `DATA_GOV_API_KEY`, `NREL_API_KEY`, `REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY`.
EUA carbon left honest-pending (EIA publishes no EU carbon price; no vetted source wired).

**Spend:** ledger unchanged at $43.04 / $85 — the data programs used web/EIA-API (free), zero
Browserless, zero Sonnet. Batch-1 spend ($13.44) persists in `agent_runs.cost_usd_estimated`
(one row per pipeline step), verified matching measured spend exactly.

**Blockers / open questions:**
- None blocking. All authorized tasks complete.

**Next steps (deferred, flagged — operator decision):**
- **First-class run-ledger table** (offered, not yet accepted): one row per campaign run
  `{run_label, items, flipped, held, measured_spend, program_total, timestamp}` so spend is
  queryable by run instead of summed from `agent_runs`.
- **Admin → Workspaces `MembersPanel`** ban wiring still toast-only; needs a platform-admin-vs-owner
  authority decision on the owner-only route before wiring. (Account panel role/remove/ban is functional.)

*(Post-session note: docs/ triaged into the taxonomy + operating manual installed in commits
`c0b4eac`/`cfa4a20`, ADR-010 — after the six feature PRs above.)*

## 2026-07-07 — P3c grounding-holes unit (S1-07, the moat gate)

**Accomplished:**
- Probe-first (read-only SQL, $0): floor bypass = 90/113 verified reg-family items on LOW/MODERATE
  priority, 72 holding 947 sub-floor FACT claims (385 tier-NULL/no-source_id across 39 items, 562 at
  tiers 3-6); ANALYSIS per-claim = 1 failing claim of 517 (Japan MLIT); stub exposure = 38/309 stubs
  across 23 items on novel hosts (all real institutional URLs on inspection).
- **Cited-host gate** (code, live on merge): criterion-2 auto-stubbing in `groundBriefImpl` restricted
  to hosts known to the item's real pool / registry / own source_url (exact-host OR institution
  match); novel hosts flagged via `integrity_flags`, never stubbed — closes the model-cites-itself
  circularity while preserving the safety4sea fix for known hosts. Pure half `cited-host-gate.mjs`
  red-then-green (6 tests); two `{ data }`-only error-drops cured in the rewrite. 244/244 tests, tsc clean.
- **Migration 158 AUTHORED, NOT applied** (per the Phase-3 dispatch): reg-family authority floor
  unconditional on item_type (model's own priority choice can no longer disarm it; `floor_basis`
  added); criterion-4 ANALYSIS label per-claim (paragraph-scoped — expression validated read-only
  against prod). Reason strings unchanged (consumer-stable). Inventory row 158 + matrix S1-07
  disposition landed same commit.

**Decisions:**
- Novel-host citations fail closed (no stub → honest criterion-2 failure → research-or-erase), the
  flag is the review channel. Non-reg floors deliberately keep the CRITICAL/HIGH condition — no
  unruled widening.

**Blockers / open:**
- Mig 158 apply rides the operator window WITH the 72-item flip figure (flips at re-validation, not apply).
- RESIDUAL (reported, small follow-on): `registerPoolHostsForGrounding` should exclude
  `canonical:cited-*` stub rows to close the cross-run self-licensing seam (matrix, P3c section).

**Next:** browser wave (operator per-PR review), loop-live dormant builds, 165-fn search_path companion.

## 2026-07-07/08 — operator "Proceed — do not stop": 158/159 applied, browser wave landed, 160 authored

**Applied to prod (delegated, verified):**
- **Mig 158** (moat gate): read-back + 3 behavioral probes green; no flips at apply (ride re-validation).
- **Mig 159** (Ask FTS substrate): weighted search_tsv + GIN + ranked RPC (read predicate inside);
  probes 12/12/0. Ledger rows 158/159 recorded same-transaction.

**Merged (all CI-green):** #244 cross-run seam + 158 record · #245 WATCH end-to-end (writer route +
one shared button; prod route answers 401 already) · #246 admin members (caller-re-insert defect
killed; PUT add-by-email; AUTHORITY WIDENED owner→owner-or-platform-admin — flagged for review; ban
copy corrected to org-scoped) · #247 community un-orphan (rail links to browse/moderation; dead
CommunityView deleted; C9 realtime mount-or-remove decision flagged) · #248 Ask FTS retrieval +
**F15 closure** (last raw api.anthropic.com fetch on a customer path → spendStream, ticketed) ·
#249 hotfix: F15 allowlist shrink (A2 stale-entry audit correctly turned master RED for one commit
after #248; local pre-push proxy missed it — gap noted).

**Runtime probes:** overrides route fail-closed on prod (401 no-auth + bad-token); watchlist route
deployed (401); overrides POST handler already runtime-exercised (4 dismissal rows). Residual
browser-only item: NotesField happy path needs a real session.

**Authored, NOT applied:** **mig 160** — the reviewed search_path companion. Census reconciled:
165 unpinned = 56 app-owned (this migration; 26 SECURITY DEFINER) + 109 extension-owned (excluded
by design). Header carries re-generation query + post-apply verification recipe. Applies ONLY in
the operator's DDL window per the standing ruling.

**Held:** loop/cadence flip (operator's explicit word only). **Next:** loop-live dormant builds
(P2-6 change-detection, P2-2/3 scan-materialize, P2-5 scheduler), double-gated.

## 2026-07-08 — loop-live builds landed DORMANT (P2-6 + P2-5)

- **P2-6 change detection (mig 161 APPLIED + #252 merged):** check-sources fingerprints the SAME
  render the accessibility check pays for (content-change.mjs, 200ch error-page floor; first
  observation seeds, outages never read as change); monitoring_queue.change_detected +
  sources.last_content_changed_at now honest. Zero extra Browserless units.
- **P2-5 portal deep-link discovery (mig 162 APPLIED + PR):** portal_link_candidates ledger fed by
  portal-links.mjs from the same uncapped render html (same-host, instrument-signal, capped 40).
  Discovery not intake — classify→stage rides the loop flip.
- Both stay behind worker-auth + global pause + scrape-window gates; nothing runs until the
  operator flips cadence. Consume steps deliberately unwired (the flip is the operator's word).

## 2026-07-08 — dispatch closeout: red-merge guarantee, reconciliations, ratification

- **Branch protection LIVE on master**: 4 required checks, enforce_admins, no force-push/delete.
  PROVEN: deliberately-red PR #257 → normal merge refused ("base branch policy prohibits") →
  --admin refused ("Required status check is failing") → closed unmerged.
- **Coverage class-fix (#256)**: proof #1 (#255) exposed that CI ran ZERO app *.test.mjs (hand
  list); run-test-suite.sh src entries are now directory GLOBS (250→493 tests, join-by-
  construction); *.npmtest.mjs = the NAMED exclusion, runs in the npm-ci fitness job.
- **Reconciliations**: (a) applies = Supabase MCP execute_sql, explicit ref kwrsbpiseruzbfwjpvsp
  every call, sole authed org "JBL studio" (NO Dietl — fresh probe); apply-records retro-written
  into ledger rows 157/158/159/161/162. (b) census bridged exactly: 47→44 (3 batch-1 verify
  flips) →42 (2 quarantined dedup twins archived); verified-live 283→279 (4 verified twins
  archived); zero generation, zero re-validation. (c) intake gate LIVE (#208 reland + mig 146
  applied + F13/C5 green + ACTIVE_PHASE flipped via #218) — cadence hard-precondition SATISFIED;
  remaining flip gates = operator word + operator sequence only.
- **ADR-011**: DDL authority ratification codified (additive delegated w/ ledger identity +
  read-back; break-risky = operator window). Mig 160 stays HELD (named break-risky class).
- **Review queue**: members-route widening APPROVED (recorded); C9 realtime REMOVED per
  no-half-built doctrine (3 orphan files, zero importers, polling is the working consumer);
  NotesField happy path stays on the operator board.

## 2026-07-11 — Reconciliation remediation (full sequence)

- Executed the 2026-07-10 RECONCILIATION REMEDIATION dispatch end-to-end on branch `remediation/reconciliation-2026-07-10`. **Lane GREEN (8/8 hard, block-state GREEN)**; spend **$3.3523 / $10**; 0 fetches, 0 mints.
- 65-item backlog dispositioned: 7 recovered to verified (1 label $0, 6 slot-forcing/label), 62 honest-quarantined with valid RD-6 deferrals (event-bound to batch-1/hold-lift). **verified-live 240→179** (fail-closed, mig-158 precedent; snapshots recorded).
- Mechanism verdicts (proof-driven): ground-only cannot fix floor-class (4b verbatim rule); resynth clears floors on enacted-text pools but has a label/slot contract gap (pipeline REFERENCE fix owed). Conservation audit's "$9.50 ground-only" plan corrected.
- **Reconciler credential is broken post-mig-157** (can't read validator inputs; WITH CHECK refusals even on same-value writes) — operator DDL window owed; mig-163 ledgered idempotently (was applied out-of-band) with proof.
- Phase 2: undispositioned 0 (94 valid deferred); 4 technology retypes all KEPT (slot-forcing + label fixes). Phase 3: 0 attribution conflicts (closed), 4 near-dup rulings (xref + 2 merge flags), URL-dedup ratified (0 live dups; 8 REGISTRY dups = new backlog), 9 CELEX/ELI identifiers backfilled deterministically, 2 residual dup rows deleted.
- Phase 4: D-1 (join selectors), D-2 (one source-count selector), Q-1 (ONE tier vocabulary + drift-guard test; 4 private vocabs collapsed), Q-2 (gap labels), Q-3 (casino DELETED via gate; 2 housing-lottery siblings archived off_domain). Doc drifts fixed (F15 count → live pointer; U-11 $0-MTD → query).
- Closeout: `docs/ops/reconciliation-remediation-closeout-2026-07-11.md` (traceability matrix + open-units register).

## 2026-07-11 (later) — Full-system audit (multi-agent, read-only)

- Executed the FULL-SYSTEM AUDIT dispatch: 13 agents (DB-1..4, CODE-1..5b, X cross-wiring, INTENT), all accepted w/ nonzero tool counts + reconciled slices. Coverage PROVEN: 1,324 code files line-read + 24 declared-excluded (= 1,348); 85/85 tables (manifest "86" corrected), 5 views, 63 fns, 183 policies, migrations 001–163. Read-only held (zero DB writes/DDL/fetches/mints/program spend).
- Deliverables committed to docs/ops/full-system-audit-2026-07-11/: coverage-manifest + 13 registers + pool-coverage-62 (45 COVERED/8 PARTIAL/9 NOT-COVERED) + master-gap-register (12 P1s) + correction-plan (Tracks A–E, build-first lens per operator: the hold is deliberate).
- Headline P1s: get_market_intel_items org-gate ABSENT live (mig 108); /admin provisional queue silently EMPTY since 157 (489 rows invisible; anon client + dropped error); profiles UPDATE silent no-op + anon email exposure; staged-approve phantom-column duplicate-mint hazard; verified-gate bypass on related rails; seed-on-timeout; /api/agent/run ungated spend; scrape-hold transport holes.
- KEY RECORD CORRECTIONS: mig-158 is APPLIED+LEDGERED (project memory/inventory said HELD — stale; its blast radius was already discharged by the 2026-07-11 remediation); 15 applied-unledgered migrations (107–134); mig-099 never applied; browserless.ts NOT retired (7 importers).
- Intent verdicts: all 9 surfaces PARTIALLY DELIVER; biggest build-axis misses = Regulations flagship corpus (45 recoverable zero-fetch post-C1/C2), Operations sourceless facts, Community pre-adoption set, Dashboard seed leak.

## 2026-07-13 — Spend-watch hardening + flag-system investigation/rulings + secret scrub (Unit B in flight)

**Accomplished — landed on master (all $0, CI-green):**
- **#299** [PROGRAM-BOARD.md](../PROGRAM-BOARD.md) (thread board reconstructed from repo evidence); **#300** T8 conduction census ([conduction-census-2026-07-13.md](../../fsi-app/docs/ops/conduction-census-2026-07-13.md)) recovered + re-verified vs post-rebuild master.
- **#301** spend-watch false-red fix (frozen-and-quiet = PASS, kill permanent-red); **#302** sanctioned-window semantics (4-state verdict in `src/lib/health/spend-health.mjs`, 9 tests; health tests added to CI suite 729→738); **#303** summary-exit false-red fix (surfaced by #302's own `workflow_dispatch` verify — trailing `&&` on empty rows).
- **#304 (Unit A):** item 0 ceiling $75→$130 (both homes `MONTHLY_SPEND_CEILING_USD` + gauge; **no spend unlocked** — `GROUNDING_ACQUIRE_ENABLED` stays OFF); item 1 seed-fallback `null_orgId` routed OUT of `integrity_flags` (119/127 were anonymous homepage renders mis-filed as data_integrity; `service_role_missing` under-count fix). Verified live: MTD $75.25/$130, frozen=false, probe green.

**Flag-system investigation (read-only census → per-mechanism rulings):**
- 903 open `integrity_flags` = 22 mechanisms; 64% of subject_refs multi-mechanism → drain-to-zero WITHDRAWN (guards-win-fights). **Dwell gap:** `quarantine-disposition-audit` covers quarantined-ITEM age (RD-4/RD-6), NOT open-flag age — the two biggest blocks (skill-conformance 240 on verified items, seed-fallback 127 surface-scoped) are structurally invisible; 450 flags >30d trip nothing.
- **Item 2 APPLIED (data durable):** C1 re-baselined to the live contract via new SSOT `src/lib/agent/contract-version.mjs` (2026-05-27; was stale 2026-04-29 in auditor + b2-progress) + drift-guard test binding it to `system-prompt.ts`. **82 flags RESOLVED** with full attribution (null-note-closure bug fixed), **65 MINTED** (51 RD-28-held for verified resting-state, 14 actionable-regenerate). open 240→223. Auditor rewired to the rule-015 guarded write path (`guardedInsert`/`guardedUpdate`).

**Decisions:** ceiling $130 (item 0); FMC ruled **1b** (keep A/B/C — subsumption check found C's 25 claims **0/25 shared** with B → NOT a dup; add xrefs, close recon flags, flag same-entity-vs-related vocab gap); item-2 apply = **Option C** (mint 65 as RD-28-held; suppression rejected); **rotation of exposed creds DECLINED** by operator; settings `defaultMode` → `acceptEdits`.

**Secret-exposure (SF-11) closeout:** 4 creds (GitHub PAT, Pet Pursuit service-role JWT, anon key, expired session token) found across ~16 local files under `~/.claude`. Scrubbed 2 live configs (settings.json 260→246 allow, settings.local.json 209→195) + purged 4 `settings.json.bak-*` + 5 `.claude.json.backup.*` + 2 file-history + 2 `history.jsonl` lines. Final sweep CLEAN except 2 transcripts (left = accepted-risk). **Held:** `~/.claude.json` (home, live `mcpServers` creds) — MCP cred-indirection ruled, queued behind Unit B. Scrub = necessary-but-insufficient (rotation declined) recorded.

**Blockers / open:**
- **Unit B NOT landed:** item-2 DATA applied, but item-2 CODE + items 3/4/5 + 119 null_orgId closures + FMC-1b are uncommitted — lands as one PR (code-vs-data split: item-2 data durable, code pending).
- Item 6 (register-step-gap): scope-not-built.

**Diagnoses (read-only, complete — queued behind Unit B):** `/regulations/[slug]` 503 = prefetch fan-out + uncacheable render; likely emitter = unguarded `proxy.ts` `auth.getUser()` → fix = `prefetch={false}` + try/catch (trivial) + ISR/`unstable_cache` (own unit). React #418 = `WhatChanged.tsx:88` relative-time `Date.now()` in render (trivial client-only mount). Obsidian = no automation; `docs/` IS the vault; `/done` + commit is manual.

**Recommended next steps (sequenced):** (1) land **Unit B** PR — commit item-2 code + build items 3 (RD-6 renewal enforcement), 5 (all-subject-type flag-age audit + invariant, with RD-28-held exemption), 4 (historical-terminal closures), 119 null_orgId closures, FMC-1b (xrefs + recon closures). (2) two-finding **diagnoses**: #418 + trivial proxy/prefetch as a paired PR; 503 ISR as its own unit. (3) **vault unit** (docs graph + session memory; ADR-010 amendment = markdown links not wikilinks). (4) **session-close mechanization** (SessionEnd hook). (5) **MCP cred-indirection** on `~/.claude.json` (copy-first → verify → delete).

## 2026-07-13 (later) — Economy-of-information: standard-floor recal + operator-priced spend + free-pass ($0 session)

**Accomplished (all $0 — no lock, no fetch, no model spend; PRs #314 `b67b673` + #315 `c51fde2` merged, prod green):**
- **Floor recalibration (SC-14 / migration 202).** Scoped the `standard` authority floor to the item's OWN authoring body (institution_id SSOT); standards-body tier (4) on own body only, never a same-tier unrelated host. Monotonic + standard-only. Applied live via the direct postgres pooler; verified non-regressive (30/30 verified stay valid). **Recovered c3 (GRI) + c4 (ISO 14083) to verified at $0** (guarded touch + read-back). JS mirror `authorityFloorForFact` + accept/reject golden.
- **Operator-priced spend model (RD-31 + RD-32; doctrines `operator-sets-cost` + `data-existence-before-acquisition`).** Retired every standing dollar figure as a limit; the paid path requires an operator-priced line (cost + inventory-miss citation), refuses without both before the acquire lock; spend-watch = pure alarm; gauge = information-only. Built by a scoped subagent (verified 38/38 + 2 agent-introduced defects — a test regression + a tsc null-safety — caught and fixed on re-verify). Refusal confirmed on the live deploy (18/18).
- **Free-pass tooling.** holdings-inventory + free-pass re-attribution decision core (verbatim ∧ primary-instrument-class ∧ error-body-clean; 9/9 goldens on the three cases). DRY-RUN = 0 genuine flips — the moat working (holding a string ≠ holding the primary).
- Meta-gate PASS (80 invariants + 43 doctrines wired); tsc clean; consistency C3 green (migrations.md updated same-PR).

**Decisions:** spend authority collapses to two mechanisms (operator-priced lines + spend-watch alarm); no standing dollar figures anywhere; a `standard`'s floor is its authoring body's tier (the T2 floor was a category error, not a threshold). Delegated-pricing successor registered as the named **pre-Unit-5** gate.

**Blockers / open:** Part A archived-row provenance backfill still BLOCKED on the reconciler credential (DDL window). The manifest is unpriced (operator's pen).

**Next steps (all operator-parked — nothing machine-runnable until unblocked):** (1) manifest pricing (`scripts/tmp/acquisition-manifest-2026-07-13.md`); (2) 124-host guessed-5 re-tier scan; (3) MCP cred-indirection fresh-session steps; (4) reconciler DDL window. The next sanctioned grounding run + the standing sequence (T9/registry/T10/coverage/launch) resume from the REJOIN point once an operator action unblocks them.

## 2026-07-13 (session 2) — $0 work queue: 124-host + 44-host disposition, T9 report-the-gap, Unit 0c queued

**Accomplished ($0 — guarded metadata writes only, no lock/fetch/model):**
- **Item 1 (PR #317):** 124-host guessed-5 batch dispositioned (34 registered at ruled tiers, 6 worklist, batch flag resolved) + SC-13 class-table extension (`classTierForHost` lazy-registration + golden). Under-count corrected (38 span-bearing not 6; readClient cap) — halted + re-ruled before writing.
- **Item 2 (PR #318):** 44-host expansion was NEVER executed → completed via the class rule (4 gov→T2 +15 spans re-stamped, 4 inherit, 1 europa.eu granularity HALT, 35 worklist). Two fake-cert risks caught in DRY-RUN (law.cornell.edu Cornell-LII mis-minting T4; europa.eu collapse). Legal-aggregator class fix.
- **Item 4:** T9 8/8 accounting — CANNOT certify (report-the-gap): 8-stage flow unspecced, 0 source-less orphans, 0 machine-gated runs. Structurally blocked on Unit 0c.
- Earlier this session (PRs #308–#316): standard-floor recalibration (SC-14/mig-202, c3+c4 flipped $0), operator-priced spend model (RD-31/32), free-pass tooling, /done docs.

**Decisions:** STANDING RULE — a confirmed ruling is an OPEN thread until its execution report lands (rulings get board entries like builds). T9 dry-proof clause closes only after Unit 0c + first machine-gated run.

**Blockers / open:** Unit 0c not built (next session's first unit, 5 parts scoped). Item 4 blocked on it. Reconciler DDL window still owed (archived-row backfill). Manifest unpriced (operator's pen).

**Next steps:** (1) Unit 0c ($0, 5 parts, per-part verification). (2) then the T9 dry-proof + the standing sequence resume. All other threads operator-parked (manifest pricing, MCP indirection, reconciler DDL, sanctioned grounding run go/no-go).

## 2026-07-14 — Unit 0c COMPLETE + standing $0 batch (vault / residual sweep / decision sheet / MCP run-sheet)

**Unit 0c — COMPLETE (session 3, PRs #320 + #321; board §Unit-0c-COMPLETE).** Machine-gated intake cutover shipped: `/api/staged-updates` POST→410, AdminDashboard approve/reject + Research Pipeline publish/archive retired to visibility-only, EESC registered T3, phrase-scan 0 residuals. T9's last gate is now the FIRST machine-gated run (awaits the sanctioned-run word — it spends).

**Standing $0 batch (this session — all $0, guarded, CI-green):**
- **Item 1 VAULT UNIT (PR #322, `8bdcc43`):** session-memory mechanization — SessionEnd hook (loud /done + INDEX prior-art + born-link), `/start` boots PROGRAM-BOARD, `done.md` born-linked+board+commit steps, `CLAUDE.md` prior-art rule + standing-rule-8 wikilink→markdown re-issue, ADR-010 pt2, dead-link triage. (The 606-link docs-graph backfill was already #310.)
- **Item 2 RESIDUAL SWEEP (PR #323, `febf336`):** (a) re-attribution worklist enumerated ([reattribution-worklist-2026-07-14](./reattribution-worklist-2026-07-14.md) — 42 FACT spans/13 items on wikipedia/legiscan/policycommons at the retired `?? 5` T5 stamp; 37 on VERIFIED briefs → logged, NOT swept, follow-on unit queued); (b) `registerCitedSources` `?? 5` FIXED (base_tier now keys off `classTierForHost`; unclassified→worklist candidate, never a guessed row; golden 11/11); (c) board debt (execution-report rule per thread).
- **Item 3 decision sheet** (`scripts/tmp/acquisition-decision-sheet-2026-07-14.md`): 35 lines → Section 1 RE-SYNTH 8 (one-number scope stated) / Section 2 ACQUIRE 17 (2A 0-KB holes 12 + 2B partials 5) / Section 3 SKIP-FLAGGED 10. Empty PRICE boxes. Caught a manifest mislabel (CELEX 52023PC0445 = Weights & Dimensions, not "ReFuelEU").
- **Item 4 MCP run-sheet** (`scripts/tmp/mcp-indirection-run-sheet-2026-07-14.md`): exact copy→rewrite→restart→verify→discard steps; github@`C:/Users/jason` + supabase@`C:/Users/jason/corvette23`, stdio/npx, LITERAL→`${VAR}`; SF-11 preserved (agent never read a value).

**Decisions:** verified-brief provenance mutations are their own verified unit, never a sweep write (production-surface-verification + four-part standard). registerCitedSources fake-cert = the same `?? 5` seen backward in the corpus; go-forward fixed so the population can't grow.

**Blockers / open:** desk reduced to TWO operator acts — (a) prices on the decision sheet, (b) execute the MCP run-sheet. Still parked: sanctioned/first-machine-gated run (spends), reconciler DDL window, `reattribution-relabel` follow-on unit (spends/model).
