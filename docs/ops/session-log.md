# Session Log

Dated, appended entries. Newest first. Per the operating manual (standing rule #6 +
self-annealing protocol), session state lives here — never in `CLAUDE.md` (doctrine, not state).

## 2026-07-07 — §7 backend sweep + two integrity-clean data programs

**Accomplished** (6 PRs merged to prod, CI + both Vercel deploys green; master `63ba920`):

- **#227** — Template 11 verifier sign-off wired to the live table (migration 154, withdraw RLS policy).
- **#228** — Map mode filter wired to real `transport_modes` tags (was a pending note).
- **#229** — Member-created vertical groups (migration 155 `community_groups.vertical`; POST route; rail + create modal).
- **#230** — Org-scoped member ban with block-rejoin (migration 156 `org_member_bans` + `accept_invitation` ban guard; ban-then-delete fails closed).
- **#231** — State-cost data program: 13 US states' 2026 minimum wage → `state_cost_facts`, read-path wired to Operations By-state sub-list.
- **#232** — EIA price-board feed writer: 4 weekly spot figures → `published_price_statistics`.

**Data written** (durable on script execution, guarded + snapshotted + read-back verified):
- Batch-1 re-collection: 3 flipped → verified, 21 held with exhaustion records (cohort-fail stop held; no forced flips).
- 13 min-wage facts (source NCSL, tier 4, each corroborated vs a 2nd source; citations = NCSL enacting-instrument descriptors, never memory-recalled code sections).
- 4 EIA figures: WTI $73.59/bbl · Brent $73.63/bbl · Jet Fuel Gulf Coast $2.788/gal · Henry Hub $3.20/MMBtu (all week of 2026-06-26).

**Decisions** (operator rulings 2026-07-07 — also in memory `project_caros_ledge_2026_07_07_rulings`):
- **Cadence stays OFF** — `scrape_cadence='off'` + `global_processing_paused=true` unchanged. Conserve the ~20k/mo Browserless budget; mechanism is ready, enabling it commits autonomous spend. Reversible.
- **Member ban = ORG-SCOPED**, not platform-wide. Redesign mock copy ("blocks the account platform-wide") is SUPERSEDED; UI copy corrected to org-scoped.
- **Both data programs RUN** with REAL cited figures — never fabricated ticks.

**Integrity note (the vetting question, answered by outcome):** for external price data, prefer the
keyed authoritative API over WebFetch of gov HTML. DOL/FRED/EIA data *pages* return 403 to bots; the
**EIA v2 API** (`EIA_API_KEY` in `.env.local`) returns exact dated JSON values + release period.
A vague search snippet ("~$69/bbl", no date/release) was explicitly REFUSED rather than written.
Same keys available and preferred: `DATA_GOV_API_KEY`, `NREL_API_KEY`, `REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY`.
EUA carbon left honest-pending (EIA publishes no EU carbon price; no vetted source wired).

**Spend:** ledger unchanged at $43.04 / $85 — the data programs used web/EIA-API (free), zero
Browserless, zero Sonnet. Batch-1 spend ($13.44) persists in `agent_runs.cost_usd_estimated`
(one row per pipeline step), verified matching measured spend exactly.

**Blockers / open questions:**
- None blocking. All authorized tasks complete.

**Next steps (deferred, flagged — operator decision):**
- **First-class run-ledger table** (offered, not yet accepted): one row per campaign run
  `{run_label, items, flipped, held, measured_spend, program_total, timestamp}` so spend is
  queryable by run instead of summed from `agent_runs`.
- **Admin → Workspaces `MembersPanel`** ban wiring still toast-only; needs a platform-admin-vs-owner
  authority decision on the owner-only route before wiring. (Account panel role/remove/ban is functional.)

*(Post-session note: docs/ triaged into the taxonomy + operating manual installed in commits
`c0b4eac`/`cfa4a20`, ADR-010 — after the six feature PRs above.)*

## 2026-07-07 — P3c grounding-holes unit (S1-07, the moat gate)

**Accomplished:**
- Probe-first (read-only SQL, $0): floor bypass = 90/113 verified reg-family items on LOW/MODERATE
  priority, 72 holding 947 sub-floor FACT claims (385 tier-NULL/no-source_id across 39 items, 562 at
  tiers 3-6); ANALYSIS per-claim = 1 failing claim of 517 (Japan MLIT); stub exposure = 38/309 stubs
  across 23 items on novel hosts (all real institutional URLs on inspection).
- **Cited-host gate** (code, live on merge): criterion-2 auto-stubbing in `groundBriefImpl` restricted
  to hosts known to the item's real pool / registry / own source_url (exact-host OR institution
  match); novel hosts flagged via `integrity_flags`, never stubbed — closes the model-cites-itself
  circularity while preserving the safety4sea fix for known hosts. Pure half `cited-host-gate.mjs`
  red-then-green (6 tests); two `{ data }`-only error-drops cured in the rewrite. 244/244 tests, tsc clean.
- **Migration 158 AUTHORED, NOT applied** (per the Phase-3 dispatch): reg-family authority floor
  unconditional on item_type (model's own priority choice can no longer disarm it; `floor_basis`
  added); criterion-4 ANALYSIS label per-claim (paragraph-scoped — expression validated read-only
  against prod). Reason strings unchanged (consumer-stable). Inventory row 158 + matrix S1-07
  disposition landed same commit.

**Decisions:**
- Novel-host citations fail closed (no stub → honest criterion-2 failure → research-or-erase), the
  flag is the review channel. Non-reg floors deliberately keep the CRITICAL/HIGH condition — no
  unruled widening.

**Blockers / open:**
- Mig 158 apply rides the operator window WITH the 72-item flip figure (flips at re-validation, not apply).
- RESIDUAL (reported, small follow-on): `registerPoolHostsForGrounding` should exclude
  `canonical:cited-*` stub rows to close the cross-run self-licensing seam (matrix, P3c section).

**Next:** browser wave (operator per-PR review), loop-live dormant builds, 165-fn search_path companion.

## 2026-07-07/08 — operator "Proceed — do not stop": 158/159 applied, browser wave landed, 160 authored

**Applied to prod (delegated, verified):**
- **Mig 158** (moat gate): read-back + 3 behavioral probes green; no flips at apply (ride re-validation).
- **Mig 159** (Ask FTS substrate): weighted search_tsv + GIN + ranked RPC (read predicate inside);
  probes 12/12/0. Ledger rows 158/159 recorded same-transaction.

**Merged (all CI-green):** #244 cross-run seam + 158 record · #245 WATCH end-to-end (writer route +
one shared button; prod route answers 401 already) · #246 admin members (caller-re-insert defect
killed; PUT add-by-email; AUTHORITY WIDENED owner→owner-or-platform-admin — flagged for review; ban
copy corrected to org-scoped) · #247 community un-orphan (rail links to browse/moderation; dead
CommunityView deleted; C9 realtime mount-or-remove decision flagged) · #248 Ask FTS retrieval +
**F15 closure** (last raw api.anthropic.com fetch on a customer path → spendStream, ticketed) ·
#249 hotfix: F15 allowlist shrink (A2 stale-entry audit correctly turned master RED for one commit
after #248; local pre-push proxy missed it — gap noted).

**Runtime probes:** overrides route fail-closed on prod (401 no-auth + bad-token); watchlist route
deployed (401); overrides POST handler already runtime-exercised (4 dismissal rows). Residual
browser-only item: NotesField happy path needs a real session.

**Authored, NOT applied:** **mig 160** — the reviewed search_path companion. Census reconciled:
165 unpinned = 56 app-owned (this migration; 26 SECURITY DEFINER) + 109 extension-owned (excluded
by design). Header carries re-generation query + post-apply verification recipe. Applies ONLY in
the operator's DDL window per the standing ruling.

**Held:** loop/cadence flip (operator's explicit word only). **Next:** loop-live dormant builds
(P2-6 change-detection, P2-2/3 scan-materialize, P2-5 scheduler), double-gated.

## 2026-07-08 — loop-live builds landed DORMANT (P2-6 + P2-5)

- **P2-6 change detection (mig 161 APPLIED + #252 merged):** check-sources fingerprints the SAME
  render the accessibility check pays for (content-change.mjs, 200ch error-page floor; first
  observation seeds, outages never read as change); monitoring_queue.change_detected +
  sources.last_content_changed_at now honest. Zero extra Browserless units.
- **P2-5 portal deep-link discovery (mig 162 APPLIED + PR):** portal_link_candidates ledger fed by
  portal-links.mjs from the same uncapped render html (same-host, instrument-signal, capped 40).
  Discovery not intake — classify→stage rides the loop flip.
- Both stay behind worker-auth + global pause + scrape-window gates; nothing runs until the
  operator flips cadence. Consume steps deliberately unwired (the flip is the operator's word).
