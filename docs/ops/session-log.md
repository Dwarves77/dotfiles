Dated, appended entries. Newest first. Per the operating manual (standing rule #6 +
self-annealing protocol), session state lives here — never in `CLAUDE.md` (doctrine, not state).

## 2026-07-07 — §7 backend sweep + two integrity-clean data programs

**Accomplished** (6 PRs merged to prod, CI + both Vercel deploys green; master `63ba920`):

- **#227** — Template 11 verifier sign-off wired to the live table (migration 154, withdraw RLS policy).
- **#228** — Map mode filter wired to real `transport_modes` tags (was a pending note).
- **#229** — Member-created vertical groups (migration 155 `community_groups.vertical`; POST route; rail + create modal).
- **#230** — Org-scoped member ban with block-rejoin (migration 156 `org_member_bans` + `accept_invitation` ban guard; ban-then-delete fails closed).
- **#231** — State-cost data program: 13 US states' 2026 minimum wage → `state_cost_facts`, read-path wired to Operations By-state sub-list.
- **#232** — EIA price-board feed writer: 4 weekly spot figures → `published_price_statistics`.

**Data written** (durable on script execution, guarded + snapshotted + read-back verified):
- Batch-1 re-collection: 3 flipped → verified, 21 held with exhaustion records (cohort-fail stop held; no forced flips).
- 13 min-wage facts (source NCSL, tier 4, each corroborated vs a 2nd source; citations = NCSL enacting-instrument descriptors, never memory-recalled code sections).
- 4 EIA figures: WTI $73.59/bbl · Brent $73.63/bbl · Jet Fuel Gulf Coast $2.788/gal · Henry Hub $3.20/MMBtu (all week of 2026-06-26).

**Decisions** (operator rulings 2026-07-07 — also in memory `project_caros_ledge_2026_07_07_rulings`):
- **Cadence stays OFF** — `scrape_cadence='off'` + `global_processing_paused=true` unchanged. Conserve the ~20k/mo Browserless budget; mechanism is ready, enabling it commits autonomous spend. Reversible.
- **Member ban = ORG-SCOPED**, not platform-wide. Redesign mock copy ("blocks the account platform-wide") is SUPERSEDED; UI copy corrected to org-scoped.
- **Both data programs RUN** with REAL cited figures — never fabricated ticks.

**Integrity note (the vetting question, answered by outcome):** for external price data, prefer the
keyed authoritative API over WebFetch of gov HTML. DOL/FRED/EIA data *pages* return 403 to bots; the
**EIA v2 API** (`EIA_API_KEY` in `.env.local`) returns exact dated JSON values + release period.
A vague search snippet ("~$69/bbl", no date/release) was explicitly REFUSED rather than written.
Same keys available and preferred: `DATA_GOV_API_KEY`, `NREL_API_KEY`, `REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY`.
EUA carbon left honest-pending (EIA publishes no EU carbon price; no vetted source wired).

**Spend:** ledger unchanged at $43.04 / $85 — the data programs used web/EIA-API (free), zero
Browserless, zero Sonnet. Batch-1 spend ($13.44) persists in `agent_runs.cost_usd_estimated`
(one row per pipeline step), verified matching measured spend exactly.

**Blockers / open questions:**
- None blocking. All authorized tasks complete.

**Next steps (deferred, flagged — operator decision):**
- **First-class run-ledger table** (offered, not yet accepted): one row per campaign run
  `{run_label, items, flipped, held, measured_spend, program_total, timestamp}` so spend is
  queryable by run instead of summed from `agent_runs`.
- **Admin → Workspaces `MembersPanel`** ban wiring still toast-only; needs a platform-admin-vs-owner
  authority decision on the owner-only route before wiring. (Account panel role/remove/ban is functional.)

*(Post-session note: docs/ triaged into the taxonomy + operating manual installed in commits
`c0b4eac`/`cfa4a20`, ADR-010 — after the six feature PRs above.)*
